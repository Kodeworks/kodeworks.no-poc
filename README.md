# CI/CD

### Continous Integration

- The `Continous integration` workflow defined in `./github/workflows/kodeworks-CI.yml` is triggered on all Pull Requests to the `main` branch.

### Continous Deployment

- The `Continous deployment` workflow defined in `./github/workflows/kodeworks-CD.yml` is triggered when code is pushed to the `main` branch, e.g. after a merge in a branch.
- The site is hosted at https://kodeworks.github.io/kodeworks.no-poc
  - The use of a subpath (`/kodeworks.no-poc`) requires a URL prefix for navigation and resources.
    - Resources can use `/utils/urlPrefix.js`
    - Navigation is [handled by NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/basepath) using `basePath` in `next.config.js`
    - The environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` used for the subpath is defined in `./github/workflows/kodeworks-CD.yml`
