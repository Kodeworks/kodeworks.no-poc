# CI/CD

## Continous Integration

Trigger: on all Pull Requests to the `main` branch  
Definition: `./github/workflows/kodeworks-CI.yml`

## Continous Deployment

Trigger: when code is pushed to the `main` branch, e.g. after merging in a branch  
Definition: `./github/workflows/kodeworks-CD.yml`

# Hosting

The site is hosted at https://kodeworks.github.io/kodeworks.no-poc

## Subpath

- The use of a subpath (`/kodeworks.no-poc`) requires a URL prefix for navigation and resources.
  - Resources can use `utils/urlPrefix.js`
    - Fonts are added using [postcss-font-magician](#postcss-font-magician) in order to utilize `utils/urlPrefix.js`
  - Navigation is [handled by NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/basepath) using `basePath` in `next.config.js`
  - The environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` used for the subpath is defined in `./github/workflows/kodeworks-CD.yml`

## NextJS limitations

Since we host a static HTML app without a Node.js server, [some NextJS functionality relying on a Node.js server is not available](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export#caveats).

Most notably:

- The [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image)-component is not available
- [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering) is not supported
- [`API Routes`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) are not supported
