# CI/CD

## Continous Integration

Trigger: on all Pull Requests to the `main` branch  
Definition: `./github/workflows/kodeworks-CI.yml`

## Continous Deployment

Trigger: when code is pushed to the `main` branch, e.g. after merging in a branch  
Definition: `./github/workflows/kodeworks-CD.yml`

# Hosting

The site is hosted at https://kodeworks.github.io/kodeworks.no-poc

## Subpath

- The use of a subpath (`/kodeworks.no-poc`) requires a URL prefix for navigation and resources.
  - Resources can use `utils/urlPrefix.js`
    - Fonts are added using [postcss-font-magician](#postcss-font-magician) in order to utilize `utils/urlPrefix.js`
  - Navigation is [handled by NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/basepath) using `basePath` in `next.config.js`
  - The environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` used for the subpath is defined in `./github/workflows/kodeworks-CD.yml`

## NextJS limitations

Since we host a static HTML app without a Node.js server, [some NextJS functionality relying on a Node.js server is not available](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export#caveats).

Most notably:

- The [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image)-component is not available
- [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering) is not supported
- [`API Routes`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) are not supported

## Dependencies

### [@tailwindcss-aspect-ratio](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-aspect-ratio)

- Official plugin to TailwindCSS used to set the aspect ratio of images at different screen sizes.

### [use-scroll-position](https://github.com/n8tb1t/use-scroll-position)

- Used in `hooks/useScrollBasedOpacity.js` to change opacity based on scroll position.

### [postcss-font-magician](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-font-magician)

- Used to load custom fonts in `postcss.config.js` using a `urlPrefix`-variable to support Github Pages without a custom domain.

## [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)

> ðŸ’¡ A React Framework providing an awesome developer experience.

NextJS enables us to export our React App to static HTML [with some limitations](#nextjs-limitations), which we serve with [Github Pages](#hosting).

## [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

> ðŸ’¡ A utility-first CSS framework that lets us provide styling without leaving the HTML/JSX.

- Utility-first means that each TailwindCSS class does one thing and one thing only.
- Uses [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) to remove all unused CSS.
- Configured in `tailwind.config.js`
- Easy to customize existing utilities in `tailwind.config.js`

## [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)

> ðŸ’¡ A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript.

- Configured in `postcss.config.js`
- TailwindCSS is a plugin to PostCSS.
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules using [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/)
- [postcss-font-magician](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-font-magician) generates `@font-face`-rules using environment variables to handle fonts hosted with subpath.
- [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) enables us to write modern CSS, and let the plugin fix polyfills based on targeted browsers.
- [List of more plugins](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/main/docs/plugins.md)

## [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

> ðŸ’¡ Helps us document components for reuse and automatically visually test our components to prevent bugs.

### Configuration

- The main configuration file is `.storybook/main.js`
- `.storybook/preview.js` is used to add CSS generated by TailwindCSS to all components

### Storybook static

- Build static version of Storybook with `yarn build-storybook`.
- Serve static version of storybook with `npx http-server storybook-static`

### Storybook CI

- The `.github/workflows/kodeworks-CI.yml`-workflow tries to build a static version of Storybook if the change detection job detects any changes defined to be related to Storybook.
